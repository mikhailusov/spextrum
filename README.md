Spextrum it's a web-player for Spotify users which brings more colors and visualisation to listening experience.

Do you like album arts? Spotify is not only music but also the greatest album art library. Some of them art piece itself, but when it comes with song it sets the mood.

Spextrum brings full-size album art to the center of attention and matches background with it.

Try to open spextrum full-screen on your laptor or big-screen TV when it's dark and enjoy.
